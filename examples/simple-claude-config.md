# Simple Claude Code Configuration Example

This is a minimal example of a `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` file that imports just the essential modules for basic development standards.

## Essential Development Standards

@modules/global/environment-management.md
@modules/global/git-workflow.md
@modules/global/code-quality.md

## Additional Configuration
