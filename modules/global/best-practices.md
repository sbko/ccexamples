# Claude Code Best Practices

## Purpose
Establish comprehensive best practices for using Claude Code effectively across all projects, optimizing workflows, maximizing productivity, and ensuring safe, reliable development experiences.

## Setup and Customization

### CLAUDE.md Configuration
Create comprehensive `CLAUDE.md` files to guide Claude Code behavior:

#### Essential Configuration Elements
- **Bash commands**: Document project-specific commands and scripts
- **Code style guidelines**: Define formatting, naming, and structural conventions
- **Repository etiquette**: Establish commit message formats and branching strategies
- **Environment setup**: Provide clear development environment setup instructions
- **Project context**: Explain architecture, dependencies, and business logic

#### Global vs Project-Specific Configuration
- **Global**: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` for universal standards and preferences
- **Project-specific**: `./CLAUDE.md` for project-unique requirements and overrides
- **Layered approach**: Project files automatically inherit global settings

### Context Optimization

#### Tool Permission Management
- **Curate carefully**: Only enable tools actually needed for your project
- **Use `/permissions`**: Regularly review and adjust tool access
- **Progressive permissions**: Start restrictive, add tools as needed
- **Safety first**: Use `--dangerously-skip-permissions` only when necessary

#### Enhanced Tool Integration
- **GitHub CLI**: Install `gh` for enhanced repository interactions
- **Project-specific tools**: Include specialized tools needed for your stack
- **Version compatibility**: Ensure tool versions match project requirements

## Core Workflow Strategies

### Explore, Plan, Code, Commit (EPCC)
The fundamental Claude Code workflow pattern:

#### 1. Explore Phase
- **Read relevant files**: Always understand existing code before making changes
- **Understand context**: Review related files, dependencies, and documentation
- **Identify patterns**: Learn existing code conventions and architectural decisions
- **Assess impact**: Understand what changes will affect

#### 2. Plan Phase
- **Use "think" modes**: Leverage planning modes for complex tasks
- **Break down tasks**: Divide large changes into manageable steps
- **Consider alternatives**: Evaluate different approaches before implementation
- **Document approach**: Clearly explain the planned solution

#### 3. Code Phase
- **Follow conventions**: Match existing code style and patterns
- **Implement incrementally**: Make small, focused changes
- **Test continuously**: Verify changes work as expected
- **Handle errors gracefully**: Implement proper error handling

#### 4. Commit Phase
- **Verify solution**: Test functionality and ensure correctness
- **Document changes**: Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- **Review impact**: Check for unintended side effects
- **Clean up**: Remove temporary files and debug code

### Test-Driven Development with Claude Code

#### TDD Workflow
1. **Write tests first**: Define expected behavior through tests
2. **Confirm failure**: Ensure tests fail before implementation
3. **Implement solution**: Write minimal code to pass tests
4. **Refactor safely**: Improve code while keeping tests passing
5. **Verify completion**: Use subagents to validate implementation

#### Testing Best Practices
- **Test edge cases**: Include boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **Mock dependencies**: Isolate units under test
- **Descriptive test names**: Make test intent clear
- **Consistent structure**: Use arrange/act/assert patterns

### Visual Iteration Development

#### Visual Development Cycle
1. **Take screenshots**: Capture current state for reference
2. **Provide visual mocks**: Use images to communicate desired outcomes
3. **Iterate implementation**: Make incremental visual improvements
4. **Multiple iterations**: Refine through several cycles for best results

#### Visual Development Benefits
- **Clear communication**: Visual references eliminate ambiguity
- **Faster feedback**: Immediate visual confirmation of changes
- **Design-driven**: Ensure implementation matches intended design
- **User-focused**: Prioritize user experience over technical elegance

## Advanced Techniques

### Automation and Headless Mode
- **Headless automation**: Use headless mode for repetitive tasks
- **Scripted workflows**: Create reusable automation scripts
- **Batch processing**: Handle multiple similar tasks efficiently
- **Scheduled tasks**: Automate regular maintenance and updates

### Multi-Claude Workflows
- **Parallel work**: Use multiple Claude instances for different aspects
- **Specialization**: Assign specific roles to different Claude instances
- **Coordination**: Ensure different Claude instances work harmoniously
- **Result integration**: Combine outputs from multiple Claude instances

### Custom Commands and Extensions
- **Custom slash commands**: Create project-specific shortcuts
- **Git worktrees**: Use parallel branches for complex feature development
- **Workflow templates**: Develop reusable workflow patterns
- **Tool integration**: Connect Claude Code with project-specific tools

## Key Principles

### Communication Excellence
- **Be specific**: Provide detailed, precise instructions
- **Include context**: Explain why changes are needed
- **Set expectations**: Clarify desired outcomes and constraints
- **Provide examples**: Use concrete examples to illustrate requirements

### Iterative Development
- **Course-correct early**: Make adjustments as soon as issues are identified
- **Embrace experimentation**: Try different approaches and learn from results
- **Regular checkpoints**: Pause to assess progress and adjust direction
- **Continuous improvement**: Learn from each interaction and refine approach

### Context Management
- **Use `/clear`**: Maintain focused context for specific tasks
- **Segment work**: Break complex tasks into focused sessions
- **Preserve important context**: Save critical information before clearing
- **Context-aware planning**: Consider available context when planning tasks

### Workflow Adaptation
- **Experiment freely**: Try new approaches and workflows
- **Adapt to project needs**: Customize workflows for specific project requirements
- **Learn from failures**: Use unsuccessful approaches as learning opportunities
- **Share successful patterns**: Document and reuse effective workflows

## Safety and Security

### Safe Development Practices
- **Review all changes**: Always review Claude's proposed changes before applying
- **Containerized environments**: Prefer isolated development environments
- **Backup regularly**: Maintain backups of important work
- **Version control**: Use git for tracking all changes

### Permission and Access Control
- **Minimal permissions**: Grant only necessary tool access
- **Regular audits**: Periodically review and update permissions
- **Sensitive data**: Avoid exposing credentials or sensitive information
- **Secure communication**: Use secure channels for sensitive operations

### Error Handling and Recovery
- **Graceful degradation**: Handle errors without breaking the entire workflow
- **Recovery procedures**: Establish clear recovery steps for common issues
- **Error documentation**: Document common errors and their solutions
- **Monitoring**: Track errors and improve processes based on patterns

## Integration with Claude Code

### Intelligent Workflow Optimization
Claude Code should automatically:
1. **Detect project patterns**: Identify common project structures and conventions
2. **Suggest workflows**: Recommend appropriate development approaches
3. **Optimize tool usage**: Use the most effective tools for each task
4. **Learn from interaction**: Improve suggestions based on user feedback

### Context-Aware Assistance
- **Project understanding**: Maintain awareness of project goals and constraints
- **Pattern recognition**: Identify recurring tasks and optimize for them
- **Adaptive behavior**: Adjust approach based on project characteristics
- **Predictive assistance**: Anticipate needs based on current context

### Continuous Learning
- **Feedback loops**: Learn from successful and unsuccessful interactions
- **Pattern recognition**: Identify effective strategies and apply them consistently
- **Workflow evolution**: Continuously improve workflows based on experience
- **Knowledge sharing**: Apply learnings across different projects and contexts

## Best Practices Summary

### Universal Principles
1. **Preparation**: Always understand before acting
2. **Communication**: Be clear, specific, and contextual
3. **Iteration**: Embrace incremental improvement
