# Team Collaboration

## Purpose
Standardizes team communication, code review processes, and collaboration workflows to ensure consistent practices across development teams.

## Code Review Standards

### Review Requirements
- **Minimum reviewers**: 2 approvals for production code, 1 for development
- **Review response time**: Reviews completed within 24 hours
- **Review scope**: Security, performance, maintainability, and test coverage
- **Knowledge sharing**: Use reviews for mentoring and cross-training

### Review Checklist
- **Functionality**: Does the code accomplish its intended purpose?
- **Testing**: Are there adequate tests for new functionality?
- **Security**: Are there any security vulnerabilities or concerns?
- **Performance**: Are there any performance implications?
- **Maintainability**: Is the code readable and well-documented?
- **Standards**: Does the code follow team conventions?

### Review Process
1. **Self-review**: Author reviews their own code first
2. **Automated checks**: CI pipeline must pass before review
3. **Peer review**: Team members provide feedback
4. **Address feedback**: Author addresses all review comments
5. **Final approval**: Final approval before merge

## Communication Standards

### Issue Management
- **Issue templates**: Use standardized templates for bugs and features
- **Severity levels**: Critical, High, Medium, Low with defined SLAs

- **Implementation examples**: Create and maintain example code demonstrating best practices

### Code Review Enhancement
- **Educational comments**: Provide clear explanations in code review comments
- **Pattern identification**: Identify and document recurring patterns for future reference
- **Quality improvement suggestions**: Suggest specific improvements with explanations
- **Knowledge sharing through code**: Use code examples to demonstrate better approaches

## Incident Response

### Communication Protocols
- **Immediate notification**: Clear escalation paths for critical issues
- **Status updates**: Regular communication during incident resolution

### Team Dynamics
- **Psychological safety**: Create environment where team members feel safe to express ideas
- **Constructive feedback**: Focus on improvement rather than blame
- **Diverse perspectives**: Value different viewpoints and backgrounds
- **Team health**: Regular check-ins on team satisfaction and dynamics

## Remote Work Considerations

### Communication Tools
- **Asynchronous communication**: Support different time zones and work schedules
- **Video conferencing**: Use video calls for complex discussions
- **Collaboration tools**: Shared workspaces and documentation platforms
- **Virtual presence**: Maintain team connection in remote environments

### Documentation Practices
- **Written communication**: Prefer written communication for important decisions
- **Meeting notes**: Document key decisions and action items
- **Accessible information**: Ensure all team members can access relevant information
- **Version control**: Track changes to important documents and decisions

## Continuous Improvement

### Process Optimization
- **Code analysis**: Identify and address code quality inefficiencies through automated analysis
- **Metrics tracking**: Monitor code quality, test coverage, and technical debt trends
