# Team Collaboration

## Purpose
Standardizes team communication, code review processes, and collaboration workflows to ensure consistent practices across development teams.

## Code Review Standards

### Review Requirements
- **Minimum reviewers**: 2 approvals for production code, 1 for development
- **Review response time**: Reviews completed within 24 hours
- **Review scope**: Security, performance, maintainability, and test coverage
- **Knowledge sharing**: Use reviews for mentoring and cross-training

### Review Checklist
- **Functionality**: Does the code accomplish its intended purpose?
- **Testing**: Are there adequate tests for new functionality?
- **Security**: Are there any security vulnerabilities or concerns?
- **Performance**: Are there any performance implications?
- **Maintainability**: Is the code readable and well-documented?
- **Standards**: Does the code follow team conventions?

### Review Process
1. **Self-review**: Author reviews their own code first
2. **Automated checks**: CI pipeline must pass before review
3. **Peer review**: Team members provide feedback
4. **Address feedback**: Author addresses all review comments
5. **Final approval**: Final approval before merge
