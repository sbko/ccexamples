# Incident Response

## Purpose
Defines standardized procedures for handling production incidents, security breaches, and critical system failures to minimize impact and ensure rapid recovery.

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels
- **Critical (P0)**: System completely unavailable, data loss, security breach
- **High (P1)**: Major feature unavailable, significant performance degradation
- **Medium (P2)**: Minor feature issues, moderate performance impact
- **Low (P3)**: Cosmetic issues, minor inconveniences

### Response Time SLAs
- **Critical**: Immediate response (< 15 minutes)
- **High**: 1 hour response time
- **Medium**: 4 hour response time
- **Low**: Next business day

## Emergency Procedures

### Immediate Response Protocol
1. **Stop**: Halt any ongoing deployments or changes
2. **Assess**: Quickly evaluate the scope and impact
3. **Communicate**: Notify relevant stakeholders immediately
4. **Stabilize**: Implement immediate fixes or rollbacks
5. **Monitor**: Verify system stability and monitor for additional issues
6. **Document**: Record actions taken and lessons learned

### Critical Incident Response
- **Incident commander**: Assign single point of coordination
- **Communication lead**: Manage stakeholder communication
- **Technical lead**: Coordinate technical response efforts
- **Subject matter experts**: Involve relevant domain experts

### Escalation Procedures
- **Level 1**: On-call engineer attempts initial resolution
- **Level 2**: Escalate to team lead and additional engineers
- **Level 3**: Involve management and external resources
- **Level 4**: CEO/CTO involvement for business-critical issues

## Communication Plan

### Internal Communication
- **Incident channel**: Dedicated communication channel for coordination
- **Status updates**: Regular updates every 30 minutes during active incidents
- **Stakeholder notification**: Inform relevant business stakeholders
- **Engineering updates**: Keep development team informed of progress

### External Communication
- **Customer notification**: Transparent communication about service impacts
- **Status page updates**: Keep public status page current
- **Support coordination**: Coordinate with customer support team
- **Media relations**: Prepare statements for significant incidents

### Communication Templates
```
## Incident Notification
- **Incident ID**: INC-2024-001
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Impact**: Service completely unavailable
- **Start Time**: 2024-01-01 10:00 UTC
- **Initial Response**: Investigating root cause
- **Next Update**: 2024-01-01 10:30 UTC
```

## Recovery Procedures

### Rollback Strategies
- **Application rollback**: Revert to previous stable version
- **Database rollback**: Use backup and transaction log restoration
- **Configuration rollback**: Revert infrastructure configuration changes
- **Feature flags**: Disable problematic features via feature flags

### System Restoration
- **Service health checks**: Verify all services are operational
- **Data integrity checks**: Ensure no data corruption occurred
- **Performance validation**: Confirm system performance is acceptable
- **User acceptance testing**: Validate critical user workflows

### Monitoring and Verification
- **Alert acknowledgment**: Confirm all alerts are resolved
- **Metric validation**: Verify key performance indicators are normal
- **Log analysis**: Review logs for any remaining issues
- **Customer feedback**: Monitor customer reports and feedback

## Security Incident Response

### Security Breach Protocol
- **Immediate containment**: Isolate affected systems and networks
- **Forensic preservation**: Preserve evidence for investigation
- **Threat assessment**: Evaluate ongoing security risks
- **Stakeholder notification**: Notify security team and management

### Data Breach Response
- **Scope assessment**: Determine what data was compromised
- **Customer notification**: Inform affected customers as required
- **Regulatory compliance**: Follow legal notification requirements
- **Credit monitoring**: Provide credit monitoring if personal data affected

### Security Remediation
- **Vulnerability patching**: Apply security patches immediately
- **Access review**: Review and revoke compromised access
- **Credential rotation**: Rotate all potentially compromised credentials
- **Security monitoring**: Enhanced monitoring for ongoing threats

## Post-Incident Activities

### Incident Documentation
- **Timeline creation**: Detailed timeline of events and actions
- **Root cause analysis**: Thorough investigation of underlying causes
- **Impact assessment**: Quantify business and technical impact
- **Response evaluation**: Assess effectiveness of response procedures

### Post-Mortem Process
- **Blameless culture**: Focus on system and process improvements
- **All stakeholders**: Include all relevant parties in post-mortem
- **Action items**: Create specific, actionable improvement tasks
- **Follow-up**: Ensure action items are completed and effective

### Continuous Improvement
- **Process refinement**: Update incident response procedures
- **Training updates**: Incorporate lessons learned into training
- **Tool improvements**: Enhance monitoring and response tools
- **Practice exercises**: Regular incident response drills

## Monitoring and Prevention

### Proactive Monitoring
- **Health checks**: Comprehensive system health monitoring
- **Performance metrics**: Track key performance indicators
- **Error tracking**: Monitor error rates and patterns
- **Capacity planning**: Prevent resource exhaustion issues

### Alerting Strategy
- **Alert prioritization**: Ensure critical alerts are distinguished
- **Alert routing**: Route alerts to appropriate response teams
- **Alert escalation**: Automatic escalation for unacknowledged alerts
- **Alert tuning**: Regularly review and optimize alert thresholds

### Preventive Measures
- **Chaos engineering**: Proactive testing of system resilience
- **Disaster recovery testing**: Regular testing of recovery procedures
- **Security audits**: Regular security assessments and penetration testing
- **Dependency monitoring**: Track third-party service dependencies

## Team Preparedness
