# Documentation Standards

## Purpose
Establishes consistent documentation practices for code, APIs, and project knowledge to ensure maintainability, onboarding efficiency, and knowledge preservation.

## Code Documentation

### Inline Documentation
- **Public APIs**: All public functions, classes, and methods must have documentation
- **Complex logic**: Document non-obvious algorithms and business rules
- **Configuration**: Document all configuration options and their effects
- **Error handling**: Document expected error conditions and recovery strategies

### Documentation Formats
- **Go**: Use Go doc comments following Go documentation standards
- **Python**: Use docstrings following PEP 257 and PEP 484
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Use JSDoc comments with type annotations
- **Rust**: Use Rust doc comments with examples
- **Java**: Use Javadoc with comprehensive parameter descriptions
- **C#**: Use XML documentation comments

### Example Documentation Patterns
```go
// Go example
// ProcessPayment handles payment processing for the given order.
// It validates the payment method, processes the charge, and updates
// the order status. Returns an error if payment fails or validation fails.
//
// Parameters:
//   - order: The order to process payment for
//   - paymentMethod: The payment method to use
//
// Returns:
//   - PaymentResult: Contains transaction ID and status
//   - error: Any error that occurred during processing
func ProcessPayment(order *Order, paymentMethod PaymentMethod) (*PaymentResult, error) {
    // Implementation
}
```

## API Documentation

### OpenAPI/Swagger Standards
- **Complete schemas**: All request/response schemas must be documented
- **Authentication**: Document all authentication requirements
- **Error responses**: Document all possible error responses with examples
- **Rate limiting**: Document any rate limits and retry policies

### Documentation Requirements
- **Endpoint descriptions**: Clear, concise descriptions of what each endpoint does
- **Parameter documentation**: All parameters with types, constraints, and examples
- **Response examples**: Realistic examples for success and error cases
- **Authentication examples**: Show how to authenticate requests

### API Documentation Template
```yaml
/api/v1/orders:
  post:
    summary: Create a new order
    description: |
      Creates a new order with the provided items and customer information.
      The order will be validated and pricing calculated automatically.
    parameters:
      - name: customer_id
        in: query
        required: true
        schema:
          type: string
          format: uuid
        description: Unique identifier for the customer
    requestBody:
      required: true
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/CreateOrderRequest'
          example:
            customer_id: "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
            items: [
              {
                "product_id": "prod_123",
                "quantity": 2,
                "price": 29.99
              }
            ]
    responses:
      '201':
        description: Order created successfully
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/Order'
      '400':
        description: Invalid request data
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/Error'
```

# ADR-001: Use PostgreSQL for Primary Database

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to choose a database technology for our application that can handle complex queries, transactions, and scaling requirements.

## Decision
We will use PostgreSQL as our primary database.
