# Refactoring Guidelines

## Purpose
Provides systematic approaches to code refactoring that improve code quality, maintainability, and performance while minimizing risk and ensuring system stability.

## Refactoring Principles

### Core Principles
- **Preserve behavior**: Refactoring should not change external behavior
- **Small, incremental changes**: Make tiny steps to reduce risk
- **Test-driven refactoring**: Always have tests before refactoring
- **One refactoring at a time**: Don't mix refactoring with feature development

### When to Refactor
- **Before adding new features**: Clean up code in the area you're about to change
- **During code review**: Address technical debt identified during reviews
- **When fixing bugs**: Improve code structure to prevent similar bugs
- **Regular maintenance**: Scheduled refactoring to prevent technical debt accumulation

### When NOT to Refactor
- **Deadline pressure**: Don't refactor when under tight deadlines
- **Unstable code**: Don't refactor code that's frequently changing
- **No tests**: Don't refactor code without adequate test coverage
- **Production issues**: Focus on fixes first, refactor later

## Refactoring Process

### Pre-Refactoring Checklist
1. **Ensure comprehensive test coverage**: All affected code must have tests
2. **Understand the current behavior**: Document what the code currently does
3. **Identify the refactoring goal**: Be clear about what you want to achieve
4. **Plan the refactoring steps**: Break down the refactoring into small steps
5. **Set up monitoring**: Ensure you can detect if behavior changes

### Refactoring Steps
1. **Run existing tests**: Ensure all tests pass before starting
2. **Make the smallest possible change**: One tiny step at a time
3. **Run tests after each change**: Verify behavior is preserved
4. **Commit frequently**: Small commits allow easy rollback
5. **Review and validate**: Ensure the refactoring achieved its goal

### Post-Refactoring Validation
- **Full test suite**: Run all tests, not just local tests
- **Performance testing**: Ensure refactoring didn't degrade performance
- **Code review**: Have peers review the refactored code
- **Documentation updates**: Update documentation if interfaces changed

## Common Refactoring Patterns

### Extract Method
Break down large methods into smaller, focused methods.

```go
// Before
func ProcessOrder(order *Order) error {
    // Validate order (20 lines)
    if order.CustomerID == "" {
        return errors.New("customer ID required")
    }
    // ... more validation
    
    // Calculate pricing (15 lines)
    total := 0.0
    for _, item := range order.Items {
        total += item.Price * float64(item.Quantity)
    }
    // ... more calculation
    
    // Save to database (10 lines)
    // ... database operations
    
    return nil
}

// After
func ProcessOrder(order *Order) error {
    if err := validateOrder(order); err != nil {
        return err
    }
    
    if err := calculatePricing(order); err != nil {
        return err
    }
    
    return saveOrder(order)
}
```

### Extract Class
Move related methods and data into a separate class.

```python
# Before
class OrderManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.orders = []
        self.email_server = "smtp.example.com"
        self.email_port = 587
    
    def create_order(self, order_data):
        # Create order logic
        pass
    
    def send_confirmation_email(self, order):
        # Email sending logic
        pass

# After
class OrderManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.orders = []
        self.email_service = EmailService()
    
    def create_order(self, order_data):
        # Create order logic
        pass

class EmailService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.server = "smtp.example.com"
        self.port = 587
    
    def send_confirmation(self, order):
        # Email sending logic
        pass
```

### Rename Variables and Methods
Use clear, descriptive names that express intent.

```javascript
// Before
function calc(d) {
    return d * 0.1;
}

// After
function calculateDiscount(orderTotal) {
    return orderTotal * 0.1;
}
```

### Replace Magic Numbers
Replace numeric literals with named constants.

```rust
// Before
fn calculate_timeout() -> u32 {
    60 * 1000 // Magic number
}

// After
const TIMEOUT_SECONDS: u32 = 60;
const MILLISECONDS_PER_SECOND: u32 = 1000;

fn calculate_timeout() -> u32 {
    TIMEOUT_SECONDS * MILLISECONDS_PER_SECOND
}
```

## Language-Specific Considerations

### Go Refactoring
- **Interface extraction**: Create interfaces for better testing
- **Error handling**: Improve error propagation and handling
- **Goroutine management**: Refactor concurrent code for better resource management
- **Package organization**: Reorganize code into logical packages

### Python Refactoring
- **Type hints**: Add type annotations for better code clarity
- **Context managers**: Use context managers for resource management
- **List comprehensions**: Replace loops with comprehensions where appropriate
- **Dataclasses**: Use dataclasses for simple data containers

### JavaScript/TypeScript Refactoring
- **Async/await**: Replace callback patterns with async/await
- **Destructuring**: Use destructuring for cleaner code
- **Arrow functions**: Replace function expressions with arrow functions
- **Type annotations**: Add TypeScript types for better type safety

## Architectural Refactoring

### Microservices Extraction
- **Identify bounded contexts**: Find natural service boundaries
- **Extract data**: Separate data that belongs to each service
- **API design**: Design clean APIs between services
- **Gradual migration**: Move functionality incrementally

### Database Refactoring
- **Schema changes**: Use migrations for database schema changes
- **Data migration**: Safely migrate data between schemas
- **Index optimization**: Add or remove indexes based on usage patterns
- **Query optimization**: Refactor queries for better performance

### Dependency Refactoring
- **Dependency injection**: Replace direct dependencies with injection
- **Interface segregation**: Split large interfaces into smaller ones
- **Circular dependency removal**: Break circular dependencies
- **Layered architecture**: Organize code into clear layers

## Performance Refactoring

### Identification
- **Profiling**: Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks
- **Metrics**: Monitor key performance indicators
- **Load testing**: Test under realistic load conditions
- **Benchmarking**: Measure performance before and after refactoring

### Common Performance Improvements
- **Caching**: Add caching for frequently accessed data
- **Database optimization**: Optimize queries and indexes
- **Memory management**: Reduce memory allocation and garbage collection
- **Algorithm optimization**: Replace inefficient algorithms

### Validation
- **Performance testing**: Measure performance improvements
- **Load testing**: Ensure changes work under load
- **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for performance regression
- **Rollback plan**: Have a plan to revert if performance degrades

## Risk Management

### Risk Assessment
- **Code complexity**: Assess how complex the code is to refactor
- **Test coverage**: Ensure adequate test coverage exists
- **Dependencies**: Understand what depends on the code being refactored
- **Business criticality**: Consider how critical the code is to business operations

### Risk Mitigation
- **Feature flags**: Use feature flags to enable/disable refactored code
- **Gradual rollout**: Roll out changes gradually to detect issues early
- **Monitoring**: Monitor system behavior after refactoring
- **Rollback procedures**: Have clear procedures for rolling back changes

### Communication
- **Stakeholder notification**: Inform stakeholders about significant refactoring
- **Documentation**: Document what was changed and why
- **Team coordination**: Coordinate with team members to avoid conflicts
- **Timeline communication**: Communicate expected timelines and impacts

## Tools and Automation

### Refactoring Tools
- **IDE support**: Use IDE refactoring tools for safe transformations
- **Static analysis**: Use static analysis tools to identify refactoring opportunities
- **Code quality tools**: Use tools to measure code quality improvements
- **Automated testing**: Use automated tests to validate refactoring

### Continuous Refactoring
- **Technical debt tracking**: Track and prioritize technical debt
- **Regular refactoring time**: Allocate time for regular refactoring
- **Code quality metrics**: Monitor code quality trends
- **Team practices**: Establish team practices for ongoing refactoring
